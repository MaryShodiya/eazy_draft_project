### The Process

Tech Used: Ejs, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MERN stack

As always, majority of my project is majorly built on my passion for the legal profession and the need to improve the legal-tech industry.
This Application contains legal drafts and agreements ranging from partnership to property deed and legal letters.

### How it works

## Optimization
Working with a lot of forms so the Bootstrap grid free template was helpful in organising the forms
